This is a project in which I created a multiple linear regression model for a vehicle data set.

OBJECTIVE: Build a model to Predict the Price of a vehicle based on its features.

TASKS:
1) Build generic linear model
2) Conduct model selection to determine best modelling method of regression
3) Check assumptions to make sure linear regression model is valid
4) Conduct final F test and T tests to test the significance of the model and its parts to see if
   it is a good fit for the data.
